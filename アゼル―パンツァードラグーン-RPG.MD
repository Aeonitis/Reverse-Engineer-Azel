# Panzer Dragoon Saga (PDS)

Panzer Dragoon Saga is a classic RPG video game that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Players take on the role of a young man named Edge, who embarks on a journey to discover the secrets of an ancient civilization while battling dangerous monsters on the back of a dragon. The game is set in the same universe as other Panzer Dragoon games, but differs in its RPG gameplay and lack of a party system.

PDS features an innovative battle system where players can strategically target specific body parts of their enemies to weaken them or gain rare items. As the story progresses, Edge learns about the corrupt nature of the ruling empire and teams up with a group of rebels to uncover the truth behind their agenda.

It is a mix of RPG and shooter elements, with the player controlling Edge on the back of the dragon during battles, using special attacks and dodging enemy attacks. The dragon gains experience points and levels up, and can be customized with one of four available dragon classes. 

With a captivating storyline, full voice-overs for dialogue, immersive gameplay, and stunning graphics, Panzer Dragoon Saga has become a cult classic among RPG fans and continues to be celebrated as one of the greatest games of all time.

## Trivia

### Panzerese
Like the other Panzer Dragoon games, Saga features a fictional language, "Panzerese", which combines elements of Ancient Greek, Latin and Russian. Saga only features Panzerese in the introduction and end sequences, with the rest of the dialogue in Japanese. The orchestrated ending theme, "Sona Mi Areru Ec Sancitu", also features lyrics in Panzerese.

### 1998
PDS had a lot of competition being released in 1998, which is dubbed by many as the greatest year for gaming, with numerous classic games released that continue to be celebrated today. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Half-Life, Resident Evil 2, StarCraft, Metal Gear Solid, Tekken 3, Grim Fandango, Baldur's Gate, F-Zero X, Thief: The Dark Project, Fallout 2 and Xenogears.

### 1001 Video Games
Panzer Dragoon Saga appears in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die by General Editor Tony Mott.

### Rarity
The US and PAL releases of Panzer Dragoon Saga were almost canceled by Sega, since in 1998 Saturn was already near extinction outside of Japan. At the last moment, the game was translated and released in US and for PAL countries, but only a few thousands copies were produced. As a result, Panzer Dragoon Saga became one of the rarest and most expensive console RPGs in history: it is hard to find a used non-Japanese copy of this game for less than $100..
