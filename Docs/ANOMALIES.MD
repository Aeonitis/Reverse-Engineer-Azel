### Anticipated Data
Data we should be expecting to eventually come across.
- [John Woo Reference](https://panzerdragoon.fandom.com/wiki/Panzer_Dragoon_Saga_Disc_1_Secrets#John_Woo_Reference): If you go inside the right-hand yellow tent at the Caravan, you’ll notice a pair of guns resting on a shelf. If you examine them, you’ll find the inscription “From Mr. Woo”, which seems to be a reference to action film director John Woo.
