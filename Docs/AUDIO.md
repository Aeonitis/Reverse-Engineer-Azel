Audio generation was provided via a specialized multifunction sound chip developed by Yamaha, the YMF292, also known as
the Saturn Custom Sound Processor or SCSP. 

The SCSP included 32 sound channels with both FM and PCM (up to 44.1 kHz
sampling rate) functionality and fully configurable channel linking for modulation purposes, a 128-step DSP, and either
16-or 18-bit digital output to an external DAC. 

The SCSP was used in conjunction with the Saturn's Motorola 68EC000
coprocessor and dedicated audio RAM, and MIDI compliance allowed use of an external MIDI controller, such as a
keyboard. The SCSP lacked hardware audio decompression.
